# Evomath

Evomath is a free, open-source mobile game, which focuses on improving your mathematical problem-solving skills in a quick-paced environment! It is developed by Chronos using react native and javascript.

## What does it do?

Evomath improves your arithmetic skills by challenging you to solve simple mathematic equations under a time limit. Although it might seem simple at first it the questions become harder and you have less time to solve them so you are always on your edge.

## **Who is it meant for?**

Everyone! Evomath is designed to be used by everyone even from the first grade up until retirement.

## How does it work?

During the game you will be presented with a simple arithmetic question such as 15+8 or 12/3. You then have to choose the correct answer from 4 answer options. If you chose correctly your score will increase depending on how fast you answered the question and you will proceed to the next question. When you choose the wrong answer you will see which was the right answer and the game will end. But if you run out of time to answer the question the game will end and the points gained from the last question will be deducted. When the game is over you will be able to see your performance and try again or choose another mode.

## **Benefits**

Arithmetic abilities are the foundation which all the rest of mathematics is based upon. If you have poor arithmetic skills all your mathematical abilities would be compromised. Besides improving your arithmetic skills, Evomath also improves your reaction and general cognition which are crucial for your everyday activities.

## **User reviews and opinions**

We have been able to get a few people from different age groups to try out the game. People really enjoyed the simplicity of the app as well as had fun by trying to solve the problems. This proved to us that our idea works in practice since we were able to improve peoples arithmetic skills by masking it as a simple and fun game.

## **What's to come**

Currently we are actively developing Evomath. In the future we plan to add more more modes, leaderboards, customizability, accessibility and the ability to play against your friends.

## **How to experience Evomath**
